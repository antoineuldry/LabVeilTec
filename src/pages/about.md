Welcome to my blog dedicated to full-stack web development!

My journey in this field is driven by a deep passion for creating digital solutions that combine **<mark>technology</mark>**, **<mark>design</mark>**, and **<mark>user experience (UX)</mark>**.

This passion is part of my Ikigai — the Japanese concept representing one’s reason for being or source of satisfaction. **For me, web development is a perfect balance between logic and creativity**, enabling me to solve real-world problems while contributing to enriching and intuitive user experiences.

## Why this theme and SSG?

For this blog, I chose [**Astro**](https://astro.build/) as the static site generator (SSG). Astro stands out for its performance and unique "no JavaScript" approach for static pages, enabling faster loading times and a smaller ecological footprint. This aligns perfectly with my goal to build a fast, sustainable, and easily maintainable site.

I also opted for the [**AstroPaper**](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme, which complements this approach with a clean and functional design, emphasizing readability and simplicity — essential aspects for a technical blog.

## Taxonomy

This blog’s taxonomy is based on the essential elements of my field — full-stack web application development — and is directly connected to my Ikigai. It highlights the various technical and conceptual aspects that fuel my interest and guide my work.

- **<mark>Full-Stack Web Development</mark>**: This pillar encompasses all technologies and practices needed to create web applications, combining front-end and back-end to deliver high-performing, interactive solutions.

- **<mark>Front-End</mark>**: Focused on aesthetics and direct interaction with the user. This aspect of my Ikigai merges creativity, technical skill, and UX to design engaging and accessible interfaces.

- **<mark>Back-End</mark>**: Here, I work with data management technologies and backend logic, including Node.js, PHP, and databases. The back-end powers the application, and its robustness is crucial for delivering reliable, scalable apps.

- **<mark>Web Application Security</mark>**: Security is a priority in web development, involving measures to protect user data and ensure application reliability. This area aligns with my desire to understand and prevent vulnerabilities, supporting project robustness and longevity.

- **<mark>UI/UX Design</mark>**: Balancing aesthetics and functionality is central to my Ikigai. User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design make applications intuitive and enjoyable. Here, creativity and logic intersect to craft engaging experiences.

- **<mark>API Development</mark>**: APIs enable applications to communicate with each other, allowing integration and scalability. This is essential for building modern, connected applications that meet needs for flexibility and reusability.

- **<mark>Problem Solving and Scalability</mark>**: This area encompasses advanced technical skills to optimize performance, resolve bugs, and anticipate growth needs. This aligns with my Ikigai, as it combines technique and ingenuity to create sustainable, scalable solutions.
